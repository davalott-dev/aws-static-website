📖 Overview

This project demonstrates how I deployed a static website on Amazon S3, integrated it with AWS CloudFront, and configured secure global delivery. The site serves as a proof of concept for my ability to host and manage front-end web content in the cloud.

🛠️ What I Built

I designed a clean, responsive landing page using HTML5 and CSS3, featuring my name and a minimal layout focused on clarity and accessibility.

The project involved:

Setting up an S3 bucket for static website hosting

Uploading files (index.html and styles.css)

Enabling public access policies to allow CloudFront distribution

Creating a CloudFront distribution with:

Origin: S3 bucket

Default root object: index.html

Viewer protocol policy: HTTP → HTTPS

Testing endpoints to ensure global access and secure delivery

🚀 Result

The website is live and globally distributed via CloudFront:
🔗 View Live Site

This project highlights my ability to:
✅ Configure and deploy a static site on AWS S3
✅ Optimize performance and security with CloudFront
✅ Implement a modern, cloud-based hosting workflow

💡 Takeaways

This was a hands-on way to learn AWS hosting fundamentals—covering permissions, routing, and CDN configuration. It also reinforced the importance of secure connections (HTTPS) and the simplicity of static deployments for lightweight projects.
